# Quantum Programming Project
By Sergio Kazatzidis y Heras, Aiden Ta Ngoc Anh, Lukas Busch and Tim Holthuijsen

This repository represents the code used for our final Quantum Programming Project.

In this repository, we define multiple Quantum Logic Gates and test their accuracies. Additionally, we define an inefficientNOT gate which applies a sequence of NOT gates on a single bit, and test what effect this has on its accuracy.
